# Stock Price Prediction with Facebook Prophet


This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using Facebook Prophet, a powerful time series forecasting library. It fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`, preprocesses the data for Prophet, trains a forecasting model, and visualizes the predictions using `plotly`.


## Features


* Fetches historical stock data using `yfinance`.
* Preprocesses the data into the format required by Prophet.
* Trains a Prophet model on the historical data.
* Generates future price predictions.
* Visualizes the predictions with interactive plots.
* Deploys the model using `gradio` and `Huggingface Spaces`.


## Requirements


* Python 3.7 or higher
* Libraries: `prophet`, `yfinance`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `gradio`


## Usage


1. Install the required libraries:
Use code with caution
bash pip install prophet yfinance pandas plotly gradio
library_add
content_copy
2. Run the notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
3. Input the stock ticker symbol, start and end dates for historical data, and the number of days to predict.
4. The notebook will fetch the data, train the model, and display the predicted prices with interactive plots.


## Deployment


The notebook includes instructions for deploying the model using `gradio` and `Huggingface Spaces`.
